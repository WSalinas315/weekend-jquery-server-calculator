# Server Side Calculator

## Description

This is a browser based calculator that sends calculation request to a local server to compute and return answers.
It takes in two numeric inputs as well as provides operator options for addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. It keeps a history of past results and allows for the results to be clicked to re-run the calculation. There are button options to clear history or current selections. Both inputs and an operator must be selected or the user is alerted with an error message.
